# Retardino Revolution: A New Beginning

## 🌟 The Community Takes Control 🌟

**Retardino** had great potential on the TON blockchain. However, after more than eight months of ongoing issues, game downtimes, lack of development, and absent administrators, the community has decided to take charge of the project.

It is clear that the original team has abandoned the development and implemented a slow rug pull, leaving players without support and new growth strategies. In response, the community has decided to rename the project **Retardino Revolution** and migrate it to the **Solana** blockchain, where we can build a solid and sustainable ecosystem.

## 🌐 Why Retardino Revolution?

- 🚀 **A Decentralized Future**: The community will make all decisions democratically.
- 🛠️ **Real and Continuous Development**: We want a game that evolves and remains active.
- 🌟 **Recover Investments**: We believe in the possibility of fairly rewarding players.
- 💰 **A Healthy and Transparent Ecosystem**: Total transparency in decision-making and fund management.
